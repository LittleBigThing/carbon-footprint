=== Carbon Footprint ===

The Carbon Footprint plugin is a collection of tests and information that provide insight about the digital sustainability of your website. You get an estimate of the carbon footprint and information about the (type of) energy use of your site.

The plugin uses the [Website Carbon API](https://api.websitecarbon.com), kindly provided by [Wholegrain Digital](https://www.wholegraindigital.com).
You can test your site directly (including other pages then the homepage) using the [Website Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com).

Currently, the plugin gives you the following information:

* Tests and information to [WordPress’ Site Health tool](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-health-screen/).
* The tests determine 
    1. whether your site is running on renewable energy
    2. how your homepage’s carbon footprint is situated relative to other websites measured by the Website Carbon Calculator
* The information gives you further insight in 
    1. the type of energy used by your server
    2. the size of your homepage in KB (kilobytes)
    3. the amount of CO2 (in g (grams)) emitted each time one visits your homepage
* Links to learn more about improving your website’s sustainability
* A dashboard widget for admininstrators to warn them when the homepage’s footprint is worse then 90% of the tested sites

*Note that the results are cached for one day by the plugin.*
