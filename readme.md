# Carbon Footprint

This WordPress plugin adds a collection of tests and information to [WordPress’ Site Health tool](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-health-screen/). It provides insight into the sustainability of the website by estimating its carbon footprint.

The plugin uses the [Website Carbon API](https://api.websitecarbon.com), kindly provided by [Wholegrain Digital](https://www.wholegraindigital.com).
You can test your site directly (including other pages then the homepage) using the [Website Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com).

Currently, the plugin gives you the following information:

* The tests determine 
    1. whether the site is running on renewable energy
    2. how the homepage’s carbon footprint is situated relative to other websites measured by the Website Carbon Calculator
* The information gives further insight in 
    1. the type of energy used by your server
    2. the size of the homepage in KB (kilobytes)
    3. the amount of CO2 (in g (grams)) emitted each time one visits the homepage
* Links to learn more about improving the website’s sustainability
* A dashboard widget for admininstrators with detailed information when the homepage’s footprint is worse then 90% of the tested sites

*Note that the results are cached for one day by the plugin.*
